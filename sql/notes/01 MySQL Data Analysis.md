# MySQL Data Analysis

## Basic SQL Statements

Six of the most basic and commons SQL statements include:

- SELECT, identify columns you wish to select
- FROM, specify the table you want to pull data from
- WHERE, adds record-filtering criteria to the query to filter results
- GROUP BY, allows you to segment the data and do aggregate-level analysis
- HAVING, used in conjunction with GROUP BY and will filter specific groups
- ORDER BY, sorts the query results by column
