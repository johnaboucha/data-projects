Select all data from the car table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM CAR;
```

Select brand names from the car table.

```sql

WHERE PRODUCTION_YEAR = 1999
```

Select all columns for all cars with price higher than $10,000.

```sql
SELECT *

WHERE PRODUCTION_YEAR != 1999
```

Select brand, model and production year of all cars cheaper than or equal to $11,300.

WHERE PRICE <= 11300
```

Select vins of all cars which were produced before 2005 or whose price is below $10,000.

```sql

WHERE PRODUCTION_YEAR < 2005 OR PRICE < 10000
```

Select vins of all cars which were produced after 1999 and are cheaper than $7,000.

```sql

## Movie and Director tables

_movie_

| ID | TITLE | PRODUCTION_YEAR | DIRECTOR_ID |
| ---- | ----| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | Pyscho | 1960 | 1 |
| … | … | … | … |

_director_

| ID | NAME | BIRTH_YEAR |
| ---- | ----| ---- |
| 1 | Alfred Hitchcock | 1899 |
| … | … | … |

Get all the data from two tables: movie and director.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movie, director
```

Select all columns from tables movie and director in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movie, director
WHERE movie.director_id = director.id
```

Use the new construction JOIN ... ON to join rows from the tables movie and director in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director. Display all columns from both tables.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movie
JOIN director
  ON movie.director_id = director.id
```

Select director name and movie title from tables movie and director in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director.

```sql
SELECT
  movie.title,
  director.name
FROM
  movie
JOIN director ON
  movie.director_id = director.id
```

Select director name and movie title from the movie and director tables in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director. Don't write table names in the SELECT clause.

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  title
FROM
  movie
JOIN director ON
  movie.director_id = director.id
```

In this exercise, show the title column as movie_title. We wrote the query from the previous exercise in the template, so you just have to add a proper alias.

```sql
SELECT
  title as movie_title,
  name
FROM movie
JOIN director
  ON director_id = director.id;
```

Select all columns from tables movie and director in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director. Select only those movies which were made after 2000. In the joining condition, let the first table be movie and the second table be director.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movie
JOIN director ON
  movie.director_id = director.id
WHERE movie.production_year > 2000
```

Select all columns from tables movie and director in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director. Select only those movies which were directed by Steven Spielberg.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM movie
JOIN director ON
  movie.director_id = director.id
WHERE director.name = 'Steven Spielberg'
```

Select the title and production_year columns from the movie table, and the name and birth_year columns from the director table in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director.

Show the column birth_year as born_in. Select only those movies which were filmed when their director was younger than 40 (i.e. the difference between production_year and birth_year must be less than 40).

```sql
SELECT
  title,
  production_year,
  director.name,
  birth_year as born_in
FROM
  movie
JOIN director ON
  movie.director_id = director.id
WHERE production_year - birth_year < 40
```

Select the id, title, and production_year columns from the movie table, and the name and birth_year columns from the director table in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director. Show the column birth_year as born_in and the column production_year as produced_in.

Select only those movies:

- whose title contains a letter 'a' and which were filmed after 2000, **or**
- whose director was born between 1945 and 1995.

```sql
SELECT
  movie.id,
  title,
  production_year as produced_in,
  director.name,
  birth_year as born_in
FROM
  movie
JOIN director ON
  movie.director_id = director.id
WHERE (title LIKE '%a%' AND production_year > 2000)
   OR (birth_year BETWEEN 1945 AND 1995)
```

## Student and room tables

_student_

| id | name | room_id |
| ---- | ----| ---- |
| 1 | Jack Pearson | 8 |
| … | … | … |

_room_

| id | room | beds | floor |
| ---- | ----| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 101 | 2 | 1 |
| … | … | … | … |

_equipment_

| id | name | room_id |
| ---- | ----| ---- |
| 1 | kettle | 4 |
| … | … | … |

Get all the data from the table student.

```sql
SELECT * FROM student
```

Join the two tables: student and room so that each student is shown together with the room they live in. Select all columns.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
JOIN room ON
  student.room_id = room.id
```

Join the student and room tables so that each student is shown together with the room they live in.

Select the name of the student and room number.

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  room_number
FROM student
JOIN room ON
  student.room_id = room.id
```

Now, use the full name INNER JOIN to join the room and equipment tables, so that each piece of equipment is shown together with its room and other relevant columns.

```sql
SELECT
  room_id,
  room_number,
  beds,
  floor,
  equipment.id as equipment_id,
  equipment.name
FROM room
INNER JOIN equipment ON
  room.id = equipment.room_id
```

Show all rows from the table student. If a student is assigned to a room, show the room data as well.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
LEFT JOIN room ON
  student.room_id = room.id
```

Select all pieces of equipment together with the room they are assigned to. Show each piece of equipment even if it isn't assigned to a room. Select all available columns.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM equipment
LEFT JOIN room ON
  equipment.room_id = room.id
```

For each student show their data with the data of the room they live in. Show also rooms with no students assigned. Use a RIGHT JOIN.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
RIGHT JOIN room ON
  student.room_id = room.id
```

Use the full name RIGHT OUTER JOIN to show all the kettles together with their room data (even if there is no room assigned).

```sql
SELECT *
FROM room
RIGHT OUTER JOIN equipment ON
  equipment.room_id = room.id
WHERE name = 'kettle'
```

Use NATURAL JOIN on the tables student and room.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
NATURAL JOIN room
```

Use INNER JOIN on the tables room and equipment so that all pieces of equipment are shown with their room data. Use table aliases r and e. Select the columns id and name from the table equipment, as well as room_number and beds from the table room.

```sql
SELECT 
  e.id,
  e.name,
  r.room_number,
  r.beds
FROM room as r
INNER JOIN equipment as e ON
  r.id = e.room_id
```

Use self-joining to show all the columns for the student Jack Pearson together with all the columns for each student living with him in the same room.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student as jack_pearson
JOIN student as roommate
  ON jack_pearson.room_id = roommate.room_id
WHERE jack_pearson.name = 'Jack Pearson'
  AND jack_pearson.id IS NOT roommate.id
```

For each room with 2 beds where there actually are 2 students, we want to show one row which contains the following columns:

- the name of the first student.
- the name of the second student.
- the room number.

Don't change any column names. Each pair of students should only be shown once. The student whose name comes first in the alphabet should be shown first.

```sql
SELECT
  s1.name,
  s2.name,
  room_number
FROM student as s1
JOIN student as s2
  ON s1.room_id = s2.room_id
JOIN room
  ON s1.room_id = room.id
WHERE s1.name < s2.name AND beds = 2
```
