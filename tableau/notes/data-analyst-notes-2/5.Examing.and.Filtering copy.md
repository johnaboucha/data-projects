# Examining & Filtering

- Sorting
    - enables users to quickly scan visualization for patterns, points of interest and key insights
	- Axis Sort, in-viz axis sorting, asc/desc on view metric
	- Toolbar Sort, button on the toolbar
	- Field Sort, right-click on field for robust sorting options, sort by, sort order, sort field and aggregation
	    - sort by a field not contained in the view

## Grouping Data

- allows you to combine related members of a given field
    - roll up data to a different level of detail, from product name to product category
	- correct data inconsistencies, (MA, Mass., Massachusetts)
	- explore 'what-if' scenarios, "what if we combined north and east regions"
- Field Grouping
    - right-click on a dimension, Create > Group
- View Grouping
    - Ctrl+Click two or more dimensions, then the paperclip icon

## Creating Sets

- Custom fields that define a subset of data based on some conditions
    - can be Constant or Computed, and be made more dynamic using set actions
- Sets are broken into 2 buckets; In or Out
- Created from the field in the Data Pane, right-click, Create > Set...
- Created from the view, highlight fields, right-click, Create Set...
- Constant Sets
    - Manually selected
- Computed Sets
    - computed based on rule-based functions, conditions, Top N, etc...

## Hierarchies

- Allow users to define custom levels of detail, and create drill-down functionality
    - dates create automatic hierarchies (year > quarter > month > week > day) but custom hierarchies can also be created
- To create
	- In Data Pane, drag one dimension on top of another
	- OR, right-click > Hierarchy > Create Hierarchy
- A [+] sign appears on the pill in columns/row, click to drill down

## Filter Shelf

- Shows filters applied to a sheet or workbooks, except data source and extract filters
- Create filters
    - right-click on field in Data Pane > Show Filter
	- drag field to filter shelf
	- highlight fields in the view, select Keep Only or Exclude
- Can be applied to current sheet, multiple sheets, entire data source, or related data sources in the workbook
- Can embed filtering into calculated fields

## Context Filers

- Dimension filters that **supersede** their normal order of operations
    - one of the more common uses of Context Filters is to create **Dependent Top N Filters**
- Can improve performance by filtering out large chunks of data that we don't need

## Date Filters

- Can be continuous or discrete, and include own set of date-specific options
- Relative Dates
    - Various intervals (last N days, weeks, months)
	- Range of Dates (start and end date)
	- Starting Date
	- Ending Date
	- Special, exclude null values

## Discrete Date Filters

- Discrete date filters can be aggregated with **count, countd, min, max or attribute**
- Discrete Date Filters:
    - Years
	- Quarters
	- Months
	- Days
	- etc.
- Date Aggregation (rarely used, mostly done in calculated fields)
    - Count
	- Count (Distinct)
	- Minimum
	- Maximum
	- Attribute

## Default Field Properties

- Enable standardized comments, colors, number formats, and aggregations at the field level
- In Data Pane, right-click on field > Default Properties > select options

## Data Highlighter

- Interactive tool used to draw attention to specific data points in a visual
- Right click on the field > Show Highlighter

## Viz Animations

- Provides a dynamic transition setting for visualizations using filters, filter actions, calculations and more
- Animations are turned ON by default
- Duration, fast (0.3s) or slow (2.0s) or custom value
- Style, at the same time, or in sequential order
- Selected Sheet, customized at a sheet level for sheets selected
