# Tableau Calculations

- Calculated Fields enable users to create new data in columns
- Calculations can segment data, convert field types, aggregate data, filter results, and calculate new metrics

- Basic Calculations
    - used to solve regular calculations, aggregation, filtering, like Excel
	- SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales])
- Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions
    - computations that support aggregation at dimensions other than the view-level
	- { FIXED [State]: SUM([Sales])}
- Table Calculations
    - computations that are applied to the values within a view, and **computed in Tableau** rather than in the data source
	- RUNNING_AVG(SUM([Sales]))

## Calculation Syntax

- Comments
    - use double back slash: //
- Parameters
    - dynamic fields that drive calculations
- Operators
    - logical symbols: +, -, *, %, ==, >=, AND, OR, NOT, etc.
- Literal Expressions
    - constant values, like strings, dates, etc.
- Fields
    - raw or calculated fields
- Functions
    - built in functions, like SUM, IF, CONCAT

## Creating Calculated Fields

- Created in 2 ways: in the Data Pane, or in the View directly
- View
    - double-click the columns, rows or detail shelf and start typing
	- are temporary, not stored in the workbook/data source
- Data Pane
    - right-click > Create > Calculated Field...
- Appear with a '=' in front of label in Data Pane
- Calculated fields can be embedded in filters, sets, and more

## Aggregation

- The process of combining or summarizing data into a single representative value
    - both **dimensions** and **measures** can be aggregated, but differently
	- aggregation level is controlled by the dimensions in the view and type of calculation used
- Common Measure Aggregations
    - SUM, AVG, Median, Count, MIN/MAX, Standard Deviation, Variance
- Common Dimensions Aggregations
    - Min/Max (A-Z), Count, Distinct Count
- Can create default aggregation methods for each field
- Can turn aggregation off from the Analysis Menu

## Aggregation Types

- Row-level Aggregation
    - performed at the lowest level (grain) of data set
	- [Profit] / [Sales]
	- happens before aggregation is dragged into the view
- Dynamic Aggregation
    - aggregated at the level of detail in the view
	- if a new field changes level of detail in the view, aggregation recalculates
	- SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales])
- User-Defined Aggregation
    - aggregated at the level of detail explicitly defined in the LOD expression
	- ignores the level of detail in the view
	- { FIXED [City],[State]:SUM([Sales]) }
- aggregated and non-aggregated fields generate an error in the same calculation

## Common Calculation Functions

- Aggregate
    - summarize or change the **level of granularity** in the data
	- SUM, AVG, MIN/MAX, MEDIAN, COUNT, COUNTD, ATTR, PERCENTILE, STDEV
	- LOD Expressions: INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, FIXED
- String
    - manipulate text-based data
	- CONTAINS, LEFT/MID/RIGHT, LEN, REPLACE, SPLIT, LTRIM/RTRIM, UPPER/LOWER
- Logical
    - conditional statements
	- IF/IFF, CASE, AND, ELSE, ELSEIF, IFNULL/ISNULL, NOT, OR, WHEN
- Date
    - create, modify, and calculate date/time values
	- DAY, WEEK, MONTH, QUARTER, YEAR, TODAY, DATEADD, DATEDIFF, DATEPARSE, DATEPART
- Type Conversion
    - convert fields from one data type to another
	- DATE, DATETIME, FLOAT, INT, STR

## Basic Aggregate Functions

- Sum, returns sum of all values, nulls are ignored
    - SUM([Profit])
- Avg, returns average of all values, nulls are ignored
- Max, returns maximum value
- Min, returns minimum value
- Count, number of items within a group, nulls are ignored
- CountD, number of unique values in a group, nulls are ignored

## String Functions

- Contains
    - return True if string contains specified text
- Len
    - returns number of characters in string
- Replace
    - replaces all instances of 'old text' with 'new text'
- Split
    - returns a string based on delimiter and starting position
- Trim
    - removes leading and trailing spaces from a field
- Upper/Lower
    - converts text to all uppercase or lowercase

## Logical Functions

- Most Common
    - IF, evaluates single logical test
	    - IF, THEN, ELSE, END
	- ELSEIF
	    - IF, THEN, ELSEIF, THEN, ELSE, END
	- Case, like a switch statement
	    - CASE [parameter] WHEN Value 1 THEN Result1 WHEN Value2 THEN Result2 ELSE Value3 END
	- ZN, converts null values to 0 (zero)

## Date Functions

- DAY/WEEK/MONTH/YEAR, returns integer value of the dart part
- TODAY/NOW, returns current date / datetime
- DATEADD, adds specified interval to date field
- DATEDIFF, returns different between two dates in units expressed by interval parameter
- DATENAME, returns part of date as a string in units expressed by interval parameter
- DATETRUNC, truncates date defined by interval parameter and returns new date

## Table Calculations

- sheet-based computations that only evaluate within a given visualization
- do not change underlying data
- created from the **Quick Table Calculation, Add Table Calculation** menus or as a **formula**
- Extract filters > Data source filters > Context filters > Dimension Filters > Measure filters > **Table Calc Filters**

Cannot create from the Analytics Pane.

## Addressing & Partitioning

- When adding table calculations, use all dimensions in the level of detail for either **partitioning** (scoping) or for **addressing** (direction)
- Partitioning Fields: cells, tables, panes
- Addressing Fields: down, across, across then down...

## Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions

- allow users to control the granularity at which a calculation is computed
- Unless LOD expressions are used, calculations always compute at level shown in the view
- occurs before Measure Filters (Include/Exclude LOD) are applied and some Dimension filters (Fixed LOD)
- Level of Detail Element: Include, Exclude, Fixed
- Dimension Declaration: Field, which data is aggregated
- Aggregate Expression: calculation to be performed at grain level
- { FIXED [State] : SUM([Sales]) } 

## Choosing an LOD Type

- come in 3 flavors to define the granularity at which the calculation will be performed: Fixed, Exclude, and Include
- Exclude LOD
    - calculated at a coarser grain (higher) than the view. They **are impacted** by filters/dimensions in the view
	- percent of total
- Include LOD
    - calculated at a finer grain (lower) level of detail that the view. They **are impacted** by filters/dimensions in the view
	- good for finding average customer order in a state-level view
- Fixed LOD
    - calculated at a finer or coarser grain that the view. They **are not impacted** by filters/dimensions, unless specifically called out or **in context**
- Use **table-scoped** LOD calculations by adding curly brackets around a field {min([Order Date])}, whereas fixed LOD {FIXED: min([ORDER DATE])}

## Creating Parameters

- Workbook variables, such as number, string, or date that can replace a constant value in a calculation, filter, or reference line
- Create from Filter
    - Edit a Top N filter to create a parameter on the fly
- Create from Field
    - right-click a field and choose Create > Calculated Parameter
	- also from the empty space in the Data Pane
