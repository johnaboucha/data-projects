# Connect To And Transform Data

## Connect to data sources

- Connect to virtually any data source or platform
    - **Flat Files** (.xlsx, .CSV, Access, .pdf, .tdsx, etc.)
	- **Servers** (SQL, Oracle, Hadoop, Redshift, Tableau Server, etc.)
	- **Saved Data Sources** (bookmarked sources)
	- Can always make custom connections too
- Connection window available on the left hand side of the desktop
    - OR, add new data source via the Cylinder with + sign, on top of sheet

#### Data Connection Examples

- Text Files
    - When you connect to a simple CSV/txt file, Tableau will populate the data pane automatically since it's a single table
    - Data Interpreter is available for text/CSV files
- Excel Files
    - Tableau will list tabs and named ranges contained in the workbook
	- Data Interpreter is available
- Databases
    - Must enter credential to access the schemas, tables and views
	- Data Interpreter is NOT available

## Prepare data for analysis

- The Data Source Interface
    - Connections Pane (left sidebar), view connections, sheets, schemas, tables and views
	- Drag items from Connections Pane to the Canvas, which visually represents joins or unions applied to source data
	- Connection Type, toggle between Live and Extract
	    - Tableau Public only has Extract
	- Filters, allow you to filter down your data source
	    - End users would not be able to change Filters set here
	- Data Grid, displays a preview of the rows and columns in your source data
	- Metadata Grid, pop-out on the left, provides basic data source attributes (field names, tables, etc.)
	    - shows Remote Field Name
- Data Interpreter
    - Can dynamically clean poorly formatted Excel/CSV files (extra rows, merged cells, etc.) with a single click
	- Review the results (optional hyperlink), will show file with corrected changes, what data was used (green), what headers (red), or what was excluded (white)
	- Doesn't always work, then use Tableau Data Prep
- Data Interface Window, allows users to transform columns and values
    - Field Operations, change field types or geographic roles
	    - Number (decimal), Number (whole), Date & Time, Date, String, Boolean, Geographic Role
	- Value Operations
	    - Rename, change the field name within the workbook
		- Copy Values
		- Hide field within the workbook
		- Aliases..., Calculated Field
		- Group, related values together while creating a new field
		- Pivot, multiple fields from columns to rows
		- Split, fields using automatic or custom delimiters into own columns
- Converting and transforming date can be done in the metadata window but the Data Grid is preferred because we get a preview of the data will look like

## Live Connections vs. Extracts

- Live Connections vs. Extracts
    - Live Connections
	    - Not supported in Tableau Public
	    - Queries database every time the visualization is created or sheet is filtered/modified
	- Extracts
	    - Pulls data from source into the .hyper extract file format
	    - Can improve performance, especially from poorly designed or slow databases
		- Additional functionality, like date conversions and field operations
		- Offline access
		- Supports very large datasets (billions)
		- Fast to create
	- Data source fields must be the same to be joined, Live or Extract
- Extract Options
    - Click the Edit button after selecting Extract
	- Data Storage
	    - **Logical Tables** keep logical tables separate and combines physical table joins into a single table within logical tables
		    - Default
		- **Physical Tables** store extract physical tables separately, and can be used to improve efficiency and leverage row-level security without multiplying data size
		    - Use caution, joins are applied at query time
			- Won't be able to perform incremental extracts, pass-through SQL
	- Filters
	    - Used to limit amount of data pulled into an extract
		- Cannot be changed or removed outside of the Data Connection pane
		- Good for filtering out big data that end users don't need to see
	- Aggregation
	    - Rolls up the level of granularity based on visible dimensions (or specified date field), and is commonly used to reduce data size
		- Can impact calculation functions, test thoroughly
	- Number of Rows
		- All rows, pulls a full data extract each time a refresh is triggered
	        - Use if data size is not a concern
		- Incremental Refresh, only pull new records, based on a specified date
	- Top/Sample
	    - pulls in a specific number of rows from the source (Top N)

## Combining Data

- Combining Data
    - Relationships, leverages related fields between tables to create contextually-appropriate joins on the fly
	    - Default option
	    - Good for all-round use cases and optimal performance
	- Joins, merges multiple tables based on a join clause to create new fixed table
	    - Used to add new columns across row structure
	- Unions, appends two or more tables to form a new combined table
	    - Used to stack rows from tables with the same columns and data types
	- Blending, visualizes data from separate sources within the same view via blended fields
	    - Good for quickly combining fields from multiple sources at the sheet level
	- Can use any combination of these, all in the same workbook

## Tableau Data Model

- Logical vs. Physical
    - Both layers can be used in conjunction with one another
	- Source data should be understood before commencing
	    - Logical layer is more forgiving than physical layer
	- Logical Layer, represents the canvas for creating relationships between tables
	- Physical Layer, represents the canvas for creating unions and joins between tables
- Logical Layer
    - Tables dragged to the canvas are called **"Logical"** tables
	- Logical tables are **containers** for "Physical" tables
	- Logical tables remain **distinct**, not merged in the data source
	- **"Noodles"** connect Logical tables together via related fields
- Physical Layer
    - Double click on a table (within Logical table)
	- Tables dragged here are called **"Physical"** tables
	- Physical tables are **merged** into a single flat table that defines the logical table
	- **Joins/Unions** connect physical tables together via join clauses

## Unions and Joins

- Happens in the physical layer
- Unions
    - append (or "stack") rows of data from one table into another (not available for all connectors)
	- used when data sources have same underlying structure
	- Specific and Wildcard unions...
- Joins
    - combines data sources using keys; depending on the source, you can perform inner, left, right, or full outer joins
	- essentially bring extra columns into source
	- possible to replicate data and adversely affect aggregation in data points
	- when connecting to a database, you'll see an additional "Use Custom SQL" option to convert visual joins to SQL code

## Data Blending

- Method for combining data from multiple sources into a single view at the **sheet-level** while keeping the sources separate (unlike unions or joins)
- Primary Source, the first field pulled in, *Blue Check*
    - Dimensions are based on Primary source
- Secondary Source, others sources that a field pulled in from, *Orange Check*
- The blend occurs on the same name/data type that Tableau finds across primary and secondary sources
    - you can Edit Blend Relationships to select Custom options for blending
	- Data > Edit Blend Relationships... > Custom radio button > Add button, then map fields that you're looking to relate
- Blending occurs on a **per sheet** level, and the primary source cannot be changed without reconstructing your sheet or creating a new one
