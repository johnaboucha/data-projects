- Aggregations, group data into different levels of granularity
- Joins, combine data sets together

    - Flat Files (xlsx, CSV, access, .hyper, etc.)
    - Servers (SQL Server, Salesforce, Hadoop, Snowflake, Postgres, etc.)

## Combine Data

- Unions
    - appends, or "stacks", records from multiple tables, based on matching columns
    - Click (+) icon > Union, OR Drag one step over to another and use (+) to add more tables
    - if need to union on > 10 tables, try wildcard unions
- Joins
    - used to combine data between tables that share common fields
    - Types
        - Inner, join matches from both tables
        - Left, includes All left and only matches on the right
        - Right, includes All right and only matches on the left

        - Right (only), only include right that do not match in left
        - Outer, include left and right that don't match
        - Full Outer, include all values from both left and right
    - Click (+) icon > Join,  OR Drag one step over to another and use (+) to join tables
- Aggregate
    - allows you to change the granularity of your data by summarizing values
    - Click (+) icon > Aggregate

    - Configure
        - Add fields, select and drag fields to Pivoted Fields pane
