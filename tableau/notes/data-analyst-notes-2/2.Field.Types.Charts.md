# Field Types and Charts

## Dimension and Measures

- Dimensions
    - qualitative fields that contain information to categorize, segment, or filter data
	- Names/IDs, gender, geographic fields, Dates/Times
- Measures
    - quantitative, numerical fields that can be counted or aggregated (sum, average, median, max).
    - Sales and Profit, Ratios/Percentages, Quantities
- Drag-and-drop a dimension to measure area and vice versa to change role

## Discrete vs. Continuous Fields

- Discrete
    - fields that contain a finite set of distinct values
	- like year, category, country, etc.
	- Blue
- Continuous
    - fields that contain an infinite range of values
	- like age, temperature, profit, etc.
	- Green
- In Tableau
    - discrete fields add a new header to a view
	- continuous fields add a new axis to a view
	- most common are discrete dimensions and continuous measures
	    - continuous dimensions possible, like dates
		- discrete measures, kind of rare, when aggregated as SUM, MAX, etc...

## Tableau Generated Fields

There are 5 of them.

- Measure Names
    - the field names of Measures
- Measure Values
    - the Measures actual values
- Count of Table
	- represents number of records in a given table
    - formerly called "number of records"
- Latitude
    - geospatial coordinates Tableau brought in
- Longitude
    - geospatial coordinates

## Bar Charts

- Used to convey **relative values** between the classes in a dimension
- Need 1 or more Measures, and 0 or more Dimensions
- Easy to interpret, easy to create
- Can't display many dimensions effectively, shades and color can be distracting
- Limit the number of bars displays
- Always sort values
- Use limited number of colors

## Line Charts

- Used to show **trending**, using time-based variables (day, month, year) and measures
- Easy to create and interpret, low user error rate
- Sequential dates/measures needed, can't display many dimensions
- Be careful with the scale
- Used date and other filters to enhance visualization
- Don't over label lines

## Scatter Plots

- Used to visualize **relationships** between variables
- Need 2 to 4 measures
- Easy to make and interpret, lowest error rate of any chart type
- Require at least 2 measures that can relate
- individual marks can be hard to locate
- Don't use time data on a scatter plot
- be careful of granularity

## Crosstabs

- (text tables) used to display numerical values in a **columnar format**
- require 1 or more Measures and 1 or more dimensions
- easy to create, and recognize, and any date type can be displayed
- can be a performance issue if too many records displayed, can be difficult to read
- limit the number of measures and dimensions, use filters to limit records, like Top N
- limit to 50 rows and 16 columns

## Highlight Tables

- Used to **compare categorical data** using color
- Require 1 Measure and 1 or more Dimensions
- Structure of cross tabs with color call outs
- Performance issues if too many records, color can be distracting
- Eliminate the number of dimensions to what you need
- be careful with color choice and labels

## Multi-Axis Charts

- Used to **combine multiple measures** into a single analytic view
- 2 or more measures, 0 or more dimensions
- harder to create
- comparative metrics of different value types in the same visualization
- scales may be out of sync
- be careful of axis, pick measures that make sense, choose mark type carefully

## Histograms

- Used to show the **distribution of values** for a given measure
- Require 1 measure and 0 dimensions
- easy way to profile a measure
- bins must be equally distributed
- hard to see across dimensions

## Heat Maps

- Used to **compare categorical data** using shape, size, and color
- Require 1 or 2 Measures and 1 or more Dimensions
- Structured like a highlight table, with color callouts and size
- Can be distracting if too many dimensions used, hard to label sizes

## Treemaps

- Used to visualize **hierarchical data** or **parts of a whole**
- Require 1 or 2 Measures and 1 or more Dimensions
- Visually interesting representation of measures, can display many Dimensions at same time
- Difficult to determine the sort, and area of boxes are hard to interpret
- Stick with a simple color palette, limit # of dimensions

## Bullet Graphs

- Used for **comparing actual values against targets** or ranges
- Alternatives to gauge charts
- 2 measures, 1 or more dimensions
- Compare measures in a concise space, clear representation between targets and actual values
- Can be busy if too many dimensions
- Year-over-year a good option, subtle colors are best

## Mark Types

- 'Automatic' is the default mark type
- Tableau will choose the best visualization based on your **field types** and their **position** on rows and columns
    - Inner-Most Field: charts based on the type of pill on the right-side dimension on Columns/Rows

## Marks Card

Provides users with ability to control the context and detail of marks in view.

- Color
    - can be applied to dimensions and measures, along with opacity, order lines, and halo effects
    - Custom color palettes can be imported
- Size
    - typically applied to measures and can be adjusted via the slider
- Labels
    - allow you to add custom text to marks, which can include field labels and flat text
- Detail
    - is determined by the dimensions in the view
    - Adding dimensions **increases** level of detail, and removing dimensions **decreases** level of detail
- Tooltips
    - can display flat text, field values/names, or visualizations
	- Tooltip dimensions at a lower grain than the view will display as * in tooltips
- Shape
    - can be assigned to specific dimensions or generally applied to a view
	- custom shapes can be imported
- (Angle)
    - show up only when Pie Chart is on the view

## Titles and Captions

- Titles
    - sheet-level headers that describe your visualization
	- can contain fields and parameters to make them dynamic
- Captions
    - display detail related to the marks, fields, and filters associated with a visualization
