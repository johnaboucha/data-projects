# Mapping & Analytics

## Geospatial Data

- Comes in two forms: **geographic fields** and **spatial data files**
- Geographic Fields
    - Can be assigned to fields in any source, as long as they're assigned correctly
    - Tableau automatically recognizes Country, State, City, Zip Code, etc.
    - All are string dimensions, except Lat/Long which are number decimal
- Spatial Data Files
    - Special files that use geometry fields, like Shape, GeoJSON, etc.
- Latitude and Longitude fields are automatically generated with standard location fields

## The Mapping Workspace

- Provides an array of customization and feature enablement tools for geospatial visualizations in Tableau
- Data Pane Fields
    - Geographic fields show in the data pane with a globe icon
- Marks Card
    - adjust map type from the mark drop-down
    - drag geographic fields to Detail to modify the grain of the map
- View Toolbar
    - located in the top left corner of map, on hover
    - has tools to enable map search, panning, zoom, and multiple mark selection
- Map Options
    - has control options related to exploration, scale, and units
- Map Menu
    - provides additional map capability like background images and map layers
    - Map Menu > Map Layers
        - control the coloration, level of geographic detail and integrated data layers
        - add/remove Terrain, Coastline, etc...

## Map Layers

- Can be customized to format map **colors, boundaries, labels** and **built-in data layers**
- Background
    - change default mapbox/openstreet map styles built into Tableau
    - Offline maps are available in the main Map menu too
- Map Layers
    - dimensional layers that be added or removed
    - land cover, coastline, zip-code boundaries, etc.
    - some layers are not visible until users zoom into the map
- Data Layer
    - additional US layers that can be displayed behind the data set
    - based on US Census data
    - US Population, Households, Occupations, etc.

## Custom Territories

- Allow users to dynamically select or consolidate geographic areas using traditional Tableau grouping functionality
- Geographic Group
    - created by using geographic fields (State, Zip Code, etc.)
    - allows for non-standard grouping
- Custom Territory Visualization
    - Remove other geographic fields except the new Geo Group

## Background Images

- Custom visual layers behind your coordinate-based data points
- Marks
    - unique location dimensions are added alongside desired measure values
- Coordinates
    - X and Y coordinates can be plotted on top of a custom background image using native Tableau annotations, like place X in columns, Y in rows

## Common Mapping Issues

- Mapping issues occur when data contains unknown or ambiguous spatial points
    - misspellings, truncated zip codes, city names that exist in multiple states/countries
- Unknown button appears on the bottom right of map for discrepancies
    - Edit Locations..., help Tableau identify locations (adding state to city or specify lat/long)
    - Filter Data, remove questionable lat/long points
    - Show data at default position, null coordinates default to "Null Island", not recommended
- Zip codes are often the source of nulls. Ensure zip codes are set as **strings** and/or **pad zeros** for zip codes less than 5 characters

## The Analytics Pane

- Includes helpful **drag-and-drop** analytics tools, including **reference lines, totals, forecasts, clusters, box plots**, and more
    - Some tools are only available for some views
- Aggregation by: Table, Pane, Cell

## Regression Models

- Regression is a statistical modeling technique used to estimate trends/relationships between variables
    - require one dependent variable, and 1 or more independent variables
- Represented in the form of **trend lines**
- 5 types:
    - Linear, used to show relationship between two variables exist (positive or negative)
    - Logarithmic, used when data increases quickly, then tapers off (positive values only)
    - Exponential, used when rate of change increases at increasingly higher rates (only positive values)
    - Polynomial, used when values have a fluctuating relationship ("bounce")
    - Power, when dependent variable (Y) changes at a pre-determined rate, like radioactive decay

## Trend Lines

- Used to show the directional trend or "best fit" for a series of data points
    - useful when your data is "noisy" or the trend isn't immediately clear
    - trend lines require **two continuous variables**
    - if using time, needs to be continuous
- R-Squared, how the variance of one variable explains the variance of another, an R-Squared value of .5 means half of observed variation can be explained by the model's inputs
    - the closer to 1 the better
- P-Value, the probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed result
    - a P-Value of < 0.05 means trend-line is a good fit

## Forecasting

- Evaluates patterns in historical data to project potential future data points
    - found in the Analytics Pane
- Needs minimum of 5 data points
- Needs 2 seasons to determine seasonality
- For 12-month seasonal cycle, you'll need 2 years of data
- Customization
    - Forecast Length, how long forecast will extend
    - Source Data, aggregate options down to the second, ignore or fill missing values
    - Forecast Model
        - Automatic (default)
        - Automatic without seasonality
        - Custom, Additive, contributions are summed, Multiplicative, multiplied

## Control Charts (Reference Bands)

- Used to **monitor manufacturing or business processes** to ensure they are in a state of control (within limits)
- In Tableau, this refers to **reference bands**
    - placed within 3 standard deviations from the mean, the normal distribution
- Customization
    - Scope, per table, pane, or cell
    - Value, percentage, percentile, quantile, std...
    - Label, none computation, value, or custom
    - Tooltip, automatic, custom, or none
    - Formatting, line, fill color, fill above/below, and symmetry
    - Show Recalculated Band, recalculate based on user selection

## Box Plots

- Used to visualize the **distribution** and **statistical characteristics** of a numerical field, including the minimum/maximum, median, and 1st and 3rd quartiles
- Require 1 or more measures, and 0 or more dimensions
