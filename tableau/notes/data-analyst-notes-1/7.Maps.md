# Maps

By default, geographic fields added to the view will create a "point map", which you can change to Filled Map if desired.

## Navigate Maps

When Tableau doesn't recognize locations, the Unknown button appears in the lower right of map.

2. Assign X and Y fields
3. Set left, right, bottom, and top dimensions
4. Click OK
