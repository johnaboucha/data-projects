# Create Charts

## Aggregations

Be sure to choose correct aggregation for what you intend to analyze.

- Aggregations
    - Sum
	- Average
	- Median
	- Count
	- Count (distinct)
	- Min/Max
	- Percentile
	- Standard Deviation
	- Standard Deviation (Pop.)
	- Variance
	- Variance (Pop.)

It's possible to turn off aggregation to see all values.

## Bar Charts

Bar charts compare data across categories.

- 0 or more Dimensions
- 1 or more Measures

## Stacked Bar Charts

Drop a *dimension* onto Color in the Marks Card to turn a Bar Chart into a Stacked Bar Chart.

The **advantage** is that we can use more dimensional values in less space.

## Bar in Bar Charts

Also known as a Grouped Bar Chart.

1. Create a normal bar chart
2. Drag a second measure onto an existing axis until you see a green measure icon
3. Drag 'measure names' from the Rows shelf onto  Color and Size in the Marks Card
4. Tableau is stacking the bars, make sure they have the same scale/starting point
    - Analysis Menu > Stack Marks > Off
5. Adjust color and size

## Scatter Plots

- Compare relationships between two measures
- Needs 2 to 4 measures, one on each Column and Row
- Creates a chart that is analogous to a Cartesian chart, with x and y coordinates

## Dual, Combo, and Combine Axis Charts

Compares multiple measures using two independent axes on the same chart. Good for comparing two measures with different scales.

- Dual Axis
    - with two measures, right-click on the right-most pill > Dual Axis
	- OR, drag the second measure to the right side of the view, a vertical dashed line appears, drop it there
	- two scales can lead to confusion or misunderstanding
- Combo Chart
    - With a dual axis chart you can customize the mark type for each distinct measure, thus creating a combo chart
- Combined Axis Chart
    - Right-click on an axis > Synchronize Axis
	- Remove the second axis to clean the chart
	    - Right-click on the second axis > Show Header, to uncheck/remove it
		- Rename first axis to represent the Combined Chart
	- Alternatively, you can create a Combine Axis chart by dragging your second measure onto the first axis in the view
	    - wouldn't need to synchronize the axes

## Tableau Generated Fields

- Measure Names
    - the names (labels) of each measure
	- gets auto-added to Color when creating a dual-axis chart
- Measure Values
    - the actual quantitative data for the measures
- Table (Count)
    - each table has a number of records value
- Latitude
    - auto created from geographic data, like State, Postal Code, etc.
- Longitude
	- auto created from geographic data, like State, Postal Code, etc.

Lat/long rely on an internal geo-database.

## Maps

- Symbol Maps
    - Each state, marked with a dot/circle
	- We can drag Sales onto Size to get circle-sizes representing amount of sales
	- We can also drag Profit onto Color to get colorful circles representing amount of profit
	- Always double-check your aggregation methods
- Filled Maps
    - When you add geographic data to the view, Tableau automatically adds it to Detail on the Marks Card
	- Change the mark type to Map to created Filled Map
	- Size on Marks Card doesn't affect Filled Map
	- Possible to color by one measure, and assign a label by another measure

## Cross Tabs

- Also known as: Pivot Table and Text Table
- Looks like a spreadsheet
- Order of the pills on the shelves matter
- The "Mark Type" for Cross Tabs is Text

## Highlight Tables and Heat Maps

- Highlight tables
    - are like Cross Tabs but use color instead of text labels
	- **do not use the Size** option
	- with dimensions on the shelf, drop a measure, like Sales, onto Color in the Marks Card
	- Text Labels can still be added to Highlight Tables
	- only need **1 dimension and 1 measure**
- Heat Map
    - like Highlight Table but **utilize Size and Color** on the Marks Card
	- with dimensions on the shelf, drop a measure, like Sales, onto Size in the Marks Card
	- then, drop another measure, like Profit, onto Color in the Marks Card
- Dropping Measures onto:
    - Text = Cross Tab
	- Size = Heat Map
	- Color = Highlight Table

## Histograms

- Chart that displays the shape of the distribution of data
- Looks like a bar chart but groups values into bins, ranges of measures
- Just needs 1 measure
- drop a dimension onto Color to break the bars down into segments,
	- like stacked bar chart

## Tree Maps

- Displays data in nested rectangles
- Use dimensions to define the structure of the Tree Map, and Measures to define the size or color of individual rectangles
- Requires 1 dimension and 1 or more Measures
- Largest value appears on top left, smallest on lower right
- Size and Color are the crucial elements

## Bullet Chart

- Good for comparing the performance of a primary measure to a secondary measure
    - like comparing actual sales against target/projected sales
- Requires 0 or more Dimensions and 2 Measures

## Mark Labels and Annotations

- Mark Labels
    - Easiest way to add labels is to click the 'T' icon in the toolbar
    - Also, click the Label in the Marks Card to toggle/edit Labels
	    - Check "Allow labels to overlap other marks." to force them to display
	- Label only **selective marks** based on: All, Min/Max, Line Ends, Selected, Highlighted, and Most Recent
- Annotations
    - help draw attention to certain sections/points on charts
	- To create, right-click on chart/point > Annotate > select between Mark, Point, Area

## Editing Axes

Continuous pills form an axis.

- Numeric
    - Right-click > Edit Axis...
	- Good to keep 0 as reference point
	- Range
		- Uniform, Uniform axis range for all rows or columns, or Independent axis range for each row or column
	- Scale
	    - Reversed
		- Logarithmic
	- Axis Titles
	    - change titles
	- Tick Marks
	    - Change Major and Minor ticks' origins and interval
	- Right-click > Format...
	    - Axis and Pane
		- edit fonts, ticks, number formats, alignments (vertical text)
- Dates
    - Dates must be continuous to get Edit Axis...
	- Tableau recognizes dates when assigning Range and Ticks

## Titles, Captions, and Tooltips

- Sheet Title
    - The sheet name gets assigned to the Sheet Title automatically
	- Double-click, or right-click > Edit Title... to modify title
	- Possible to add (Insert) variables to create dynamic titles
- Captions
    - Off by default
	- Enable from Worksheet Menu > Show Caption
	- Used to describe visualization, or add notes
- Tooltips
    - auto populated by Tableau with current pills in the view
	- possible to edit/add text, insert variables (Insert), and even other sheets
