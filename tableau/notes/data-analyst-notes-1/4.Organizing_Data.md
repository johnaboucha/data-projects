# Organizing and Simplifying Data

## Groups

A group will combine related members in a field.

1. Right-click a field in the Data Pane > Create > Group...
    - Select values you want to group
	- the Find Members section allow you to locate values easier
2. OR, highlight labels in the view, in popup, select paperclip
3. OR, select marks in the view, in popup, select paperclip

- Paperclip icon represents a group
- Default name is created by combining members of group
- Groups are fixed

## Sets

- Sets are dynamic, based on calculations/conditions/Top N
- Creates In and Out groups
- Represented by overlapping circles icon

## Sorting

- In ascending or descending order
- Manual Sort, define your custom sort order

1. Sort by the ASC and DESC buttons in the toolbar
2. OR, click the sort icon on the axis
    - alphabetic
3. OR, right-click pill on the shelf > Sort...
	- Alphabetic
    - Field, allows sorting by fields not in the view
	- Manual, assigning manual sort, dragging fields up and down
	    - any additional sorting will cause Tableau to overwrite manual sorts

## Hierarchies

- Collections of fields that form a hierarchy
- Order of fields matter
- For example, Country > Region > State > City > Zip
- Represented by rectangles connected by lines icon
- Tableau automatically separates date fields into hierarchies

1. Drag one field on top of another to create a hierarchy
2. OR, right-click on a field > Hierarchy > then...
    - Create Hierarchy...
	- Or, Add to Hierarchy...

- Hierarchies allow you to drill down by clicking the [+] symbol when pills shown in the Shelf
- Click the [-] icon to drill back up

## Filters

Filters allow us to limit what we see in the view to let us focus on only the relevant information.

- Create a Filter
    - Drag a field onto the Filter Card
	- Or, highlight marks in the view and select Keep Only or Exclude

- Filtering
    - General
	    - Select from list
		- Custom value list
		- Use all
	- Wildcard
	- Condition
	- Top

All values still exist in the workbook, just filtering from the specific view in a Sheet

- Show Filter
    - right-click on filter > Show Filter

When filtering by Dimension > Select discrete values.
When filtering by Measure > Select all or aggregation > choose range

When filtering by Date, you can filter by continuous values (as ranges) or as discrete dates (date parts) or by some aggregations, like Min/Max, Count

## Tableau's Order of Operations

- a.k.a. The Query Pipeline

Filters execute in a formal order.

1. Extract
2. Data Source Filters
3. Context Filters
    - Sets, conditional filters, top N, Fixed LOD
4. Dimension Filters
    - Include/Exclude LOD, data blending
5. Measure Filters
    - Forecasts, table calculations, clusters, totals
6. Table Calc Filters
    - trend lines, reference lines

## Context Filters

By default, all filters are computed independently. Each filter accesses all rows in the data source regardless of other filters.

Use Context Filters for 2 reasons:
- Improve performance
- Create dependent numerical or Top N filters, lets only the data of interest to pass through

Additional filters are applied to data from the Context Filter, which makes it faster.

Create a Context Filter:
- right-click on field pill in Filters > Add to Context
