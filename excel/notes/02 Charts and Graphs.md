# Excel: Charts and Graphs

When creating charts, strive for clarity and simplicity. Focus on creating a narrative and telling a story. Selecting the right type of chart is critical.

Three important things to consider when creating charts:

1. What type of data are you working with?
  - Integer, time-series, geo-spatial…
2. What are you intending to communicate?
  - Relationship, trends, distribution…
3. Who is consuming this information?

Add a chart in Excel under the Insert menu option. Excel will automatically find your table data to create the chart. However, you will need to manually select columns you wish to chart if you don’t want all columns to be plotted.

**Chart Design** has various features that will customize the chart elements, like titles, axes, color and chart type. **Format** will customize options like font, shapes, accessibility, and size of chart.

When formatting a chart, it’s more straight forward to just right-click an element on the chart and edit and choosing the format option.

When plotting two data series, it’s possible to assign a **secondary axis** for one under Change Chart Type > Combo > and select Secondary Axis option. You can also right-click on a data set > Format Data Series… > and choose Secondary Axis there too.

**Bar and Column charts** are commonly used to compare numerical data across categories.

**Histogram and Pareto** charts are good for showing distribution of continuous data. Common examples might include frequency of test scores, population by age group, distribution of heights or weights…

**Line charts** are good for visualizing trends over time. Super easy to make. Easy to add trend lines, linear or polynomial. Possible to combine line and column charts.

**Area Charts** are good to show changes in data composition over time. Examples could include transparent series or stacked area chart like sales by department, month, percent of downloads by browser/month. Keep number of categories below six to keep things readable.

**Pie and Donut** charts can be good for comparing proportions of the whole. Common examples might include percentage of budget spent, proportion of internet users by age, and etc. Keep slices to 6 or less.

**Scatterplots** are great for exploring correlations and relationships between numerical series. Examples can include hockey goals and salary, ice cream sales by temperature, weight by age. Trend lines can be added.

**Bubble Charts** are similar to scatterplots but they add size to the bubble as a third dimension. Possible to add color as a fourth dimension too.

**Box and Whisker** charts are good to visualize statistical characteristics across data series, like comparing annual rainfall across cities.

**Tree maps** are good for visualizing hierarchical data that has natural grouping and sub-grouping with 1 or 2 hierarchical levels. It’s important to have your data grouped and sorted first before creating the chart.

**Waterfall charts** are good for showing net values after a series of positive and negative contributions. Common to use with corporate balance sheets and personal income and spending.

**Funnel charts** are good to show progress through the stages towards a goal, like the volume of views, clicks, and sales on an e-commerce website.

**Radar charts** are good for plotting 3 or more quantitative variables on a two-dimensional chart, relative to a central point. Nice for comparing test scores across multiple subjects/dimensions. Normalize each metric to the same scale.

**Stock charts** are best for visualizing stock market data, including volume, high, low, open, and close. Manually set axis minimum and maximum values to improve readability.

**Heat maps** are good for showing trends or relationships using color scales. Examples might include accident rates by time of day and day of week, average temperature by city and month. Make sure to use sensible color choices.

In Excel, highlight your data values and go to Home > Conditional Formatting to add color to cells. Then right-click data, format cells > Custom and enter “;;;” to remove numbers.

**Surface and Contour charts** can be useful for plotting data in three dimensions to find optimum combinations of values. Heat maps might be better in some cases.

**Geospatial/choropleth maps** are best for showing location-based data, like rainfall by state, unemployment rate by country, etc…

**Sparklines** are like miniature line or column charts squeezed into a single cell.
